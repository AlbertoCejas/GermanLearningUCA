'Guess it!: Language Trainer' is a gamificated app for smartphones that aims to enhance students’ foreign language learning outside the classroom (informal learning). 

It focuses on encouraging learners to communicate with each other and the language instructor through community driven learning activities. This way, students interact, amongst each other, by sharing, assessing and co-constructing their knowledge based on a highly interactive, ubiquitous and constructive learning approach that the APP implements.

It currently supports the following languages:
* German
* English
* Russian
