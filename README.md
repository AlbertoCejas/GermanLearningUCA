'Guess it!: Language Trainer' is a gamificated app for smartphones that aims to enhance students’ foreign language learning outside the classroom (informal learning). 

It focuses on encouraging learners to communicate with each other and the language instructor through community driven learning activities. This way, students interact, amongst each other, by sharing, assessing and co-constructing their knowledge based on a highly interactive, ubiquitous and constructive learning approach that the APP implements.

This project has been funded in University of Cadiz programme for Researching and Innovation in Education 2014/15, under the "El aprendizaje ubicuo y comunitario de lenguas extranjeras con el uso de una app gamificada, una evaluación por pares y algoritmos inteligentes" project (code sol-201400047372-tra)
